# Typescript/Javascript Practice Problems

This was originally copied from https://github.com/codingforinterviews/practice-problems

Usage:

```bash
npm install
```

then

```bash
npm test
```

or

```bash
npm run test-watch
```

array_rotate is setup with an incomplete implementation and a single test. You can start here by finishing the
implementation and writing tests.

Note: This does not require you to write Typescript if you don't want to, but the file extensions must be .ts. 
All strict type checking is turned off by default.
